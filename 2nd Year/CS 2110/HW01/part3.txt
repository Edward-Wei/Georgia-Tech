1) Give the topmost 4 bit input pin a value of 1011, give the other 4 bit input pin a 		value of 0001, and give the 2 bit input pin a value of 10	a) What hexadecimal number is displayed on the register?
		b1	b) What value is showing on the output pin?
		112) What happens when you press down the button that was created in step 6?
	The hexadecimal value in the register becomes 00 as well as the output pin.3) What situations will cause a red wire in logisim?
	When a circuit has two inputs that are joined without a splitter and directed 		towards an input. This essentially is forcing two values into the input at once 	causing a conflict.4) What situations will cause a orange wire in logisim?
	An orange wire will typically appear when there's a conflict with incompatible 		widths between an one side of the wire (output) and the other (input).
