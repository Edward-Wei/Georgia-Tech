======================================================================

This is not a timed lab, so feel free to collaborate with your neighbors, use
the book, and ask the TAs for explanation if you need help. When you are done,
please submit your assignment to T-Square to get "credit" for participating.

Note when doing these labs please only add your answers to this file.


Problem 1 (Easy)
---------
Answer the following.

So I have three LEDS red, green, and blue. And I want the circuit to behave as follows.

1) None of the LEDS are turned on
2) The red LED is the only led that is on
3) The green LED is the only led that is on
4) The blue LED is the only led that is on
5) All of the LEDs are turned on

So the leds should go
None On -> Red On -> Green On -> Blue On -> Red On, Green On, Blue On -> Back to None On.

Note that there are no inputs to this state machine, the transitions automatically happen after one clock cycle.
And there is only 3 output wires for this state machine Red, Green, and Blue.
Please note that there are always two implied inputs to the state machine CLK and RESET. Do not include these signals in your state diagram.

1) How many states will you need for this state machine?

4) Now draw a state machine diagram for this circuit I suggest working with someone near you and getting a TA to check it over once you are done.
You can do this on paper or in paint or something. (You don't have to turn this in for this lab assignment)

5) Now take the state machine diagram you created and make it into a logisim circuit name it lab7Part1.circ


Problem 2 (Medium)
---------
So I then showed my circuit to Bill and he was not too happy with it since the LEDS flash all of the time!
Bill has told me that I should add an on/off button to my circuit to turn the flashing LEDs on and off.

Requirements
1) The machine starts off with the lights turned off
2) When I PRESS AND RELEASE the On/Off button the lights should behave as like in previous problem
3) When I PRESS AND RELEASE the button WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE ALL ON state the lights should turn off
4) Afterward if I PRESS AND RELEASE the button again it should turn the lights on again.

1) How many states will you need for this state machine (Should be more than problem 1)?
2) How many inputs will this circuit have?
3) How many outputs will you now have to this state machine?
Note: Make sure that when I press the button that the machine doesn't turn on/off very rapidly! (Hint: dummy states)

4) Now draw a state machine diagram for this circuit I suggest working with someone near you and getting a TA to check it over once you are done.
(You don't have to turn this in for this lab assignment)

5) Implement this state machine as a circuit. Save it as lab7Part2.circ
(Note you should not use the Kmap style of building a state machine circuit as you have to do in the homework.
You should build this using the onehot, that is, one bit per state way of doing this as bill discussed in class).

However if you want a challenge this problem will be a 5 variable kmap.

Problem 3 (Hard)
---------
This system has three inputs as buttons A, B, and C and an output which is a single LED.  

Requirements
1) The circuit starts off with the LED turned off.
2) When button A is pressed then the LED should turn on and stay on even after A is released.
3) When button B is pressed the LED should BLINK repeatedly (THAT is one clock cycle it is on the next it is off) even after B is released.
4) When button C is pressed the LED should turn off and stay off even after C is released.

1) Draw a state machine diagram for this circuit.  This one may be a bit tricky!

2) How many states will you need for this state machine?
3) How many inputs?
4) How many outputs?

5) Implement this state machine as a circuit. Save it as lab7Part3.circ
(Note like the above problem you should not use the Kmap style of building a state machine circuit as you have to do in the homework.
You should build this using the onehot, that is, one bit per state way of doing this as bill discussed in class).
