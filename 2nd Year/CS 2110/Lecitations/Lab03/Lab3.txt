======================================================================

This is not a timed lab, so feel free to collaborate with your neighbors, use
the book, and ask the TAs for explanation if you need help. When you are done,
please submit your assignment to T-Square to get "credit" for participating.

Note when doing these labs please only add your answers to this file.

----------------
Part 1: Bitmasks
----------------

Write a bitmask and the bitwise operation to perform to do each task!

Bit numbering is as follows (we start at the least significant digit as 0)

1101011101
9876543210

Example (here is your one and only freebie)
Q) Set the last bit (bit 0) to a 1
A) You would use the operator | and mask 0x1

a) Clear all of the bits in a number except for bit 3
	A) Use the & operator and mask 0x8
b) Set bits 2, 4, 7, 9 to a 1
	A) Use the | operator and mask 0x294
c) Flip bits 0-3.
	A) Use the ^ operator and mask 0xF
d) Clear bits 4-7 AND then Set bits 0-2 to 1
	A) Use the complement of 0 and use the ^ operator and mask it with 0xF0. Use that result and use the & operator to clear bits 4-7. Then use the | operator with the mask 0x7.
e) Flip bits 10-14 AND then Clear bits 2-5 AND then Set Bits 7-9
	A) Use the ^ operator with 0x7C00 to flip the bits 10-14. Use the complement of 0 and use the ^ operator and mask it with 0x3C to clear bits 2-5. Then use the | operator with the mask 0x38

Part 2: Transistors
-------------------
Transistors are like tiny electrical switches. Logic gates (like AND gates,
OR gates, etc.) are composed of transistors in much the same way that the
functional units you will build later are composed of logic gates. There are
2 types of MOS (metal-oxide semiconductors) transistors.

Your job is to now build some logic gates

Note: Please follow the convention that your p-type gates are at the top of your circuit connected to power
and n-type gates are at the bottom.

As long as the FINAL output of your circuit is not blue or red your circuit is correct. 
You may see some blue wires connecting into your transistors this is fine.

A) Build a nand gate and build a or gate save your answer as lab3Part1.circ

B) Look at the image mystery.png what basic logic gate is this?  Can you give me a truth table for it?
	
	XOR logic gate
	Truth Table
	0 0 --> 0
	0 1 --> 1
	1 0 --> 1
	1 1 --> 0
