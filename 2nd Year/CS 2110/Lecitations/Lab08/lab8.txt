======================================================================

This is not a timed lab, so feel free to collaborate with your neighbors, use
the book, and ask the TAs for explanation if you need help. When you are done,
please submit your assignment to T-Square to get credit! for participating.


1) Assemble the following instructions and tell me what does it do.

a) ADD R4, R5, 10
	A) The instruction adds the value stored in R5 to 10 and stores the result in R4

b) LDR R2, R3, #0
	A) The instruction sign extends bits [5:0] to 16 bits and adds the result to R3 and stores that result to R2.

2) Tell me in control signals how to do the following actions on the datapath given in this assignment.

a) Store the PC into DR. that is DR = PC
	A) GatePC, LDREG

b) Increment the PC. that is PC++
	A) LDPC, PCMUX

c) Move the PC to the MAR. that is MAR = PC.
	A) GatePC, LDMAR

3) How does the lea instruction work in the datapath your answer should be in terms of control signals! i.e. LdPC
	A) ADDR2MUX=[8:0],ADDR1MUX=PC,MARMUX=ADDER,GateMARMUX,LDREG,LDCC

a) (The LEA instruction)
LEA Reg, Offset


[If you are done with the above 3 problems here is one more]
4) Here I have this simple assembly program. Can you tell me what is in each of the indicated registers after I run it?
Notes 
.orig is NOT an instruction it tells the assembler where to put your code.  The convention is to put your program at x3000.
You may have multiple .orig statements.  
.end is also NOT an instruction it tells the assembler that this is the end of a block of code.
.fill tells the assembler to put a certain value at a certain address as an example at memory address x3006 will be the value x3500.
the ';' Denotes a comment in LC-3.  Each line of code is followed by the address in memory where it is located.

HALT tells the processor to STOP EXECUTION.


.orig x3000
	LEA R0, SIMPLE 		;x3000
	LD R1, SIMPLE   	;x3001
	LDR R2, R1, 0  		;x3002
	LDR R3, R1, 1  		;x3003
	LDI R4, SIMPLE  	;x3004
	HALT			;x3005

	SIMPLE .fill x3500	;x3006
	BLARRG .fill 2110	;x3007
.end

.orig x3500
	ITSOVER .fill 9000	;x3500
	RANDOM .fill 42		;x3501
.end
