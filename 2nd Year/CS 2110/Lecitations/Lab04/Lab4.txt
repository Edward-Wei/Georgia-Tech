======================================================================

This is not a timed lab, so feel free to collaborate with your neighbors, use
the book, and ask the TAs for explanation if you need help. When you are done,
please submit your assignment to T-Square to get "credit" for participating.

Note when doing these labs please only add your answers to this file.

-------------------
Part 1: Transistors
-------------------

Your job is to now build some logic gates

Note: Please follow the convention that your p-type gates are at the top of your circuit connected to power
and n-type gates are at the bottom.

As long as the FINAL output of your circuit is not blue or red your circuit is correct. 
You may see some blue wires connecting into your transistors this is fine.

A) Build a 3 input nand gate save your answer as lab4Part1.circ


Hints:  First draw a truth table then make sure that POWER is connected to the output when the output is 1
and GROUP is connected to the output when the output is 0.

Part 2: Decoders/Encoders/Multiplexors
======================================
(Save your answer to this part as lab4Part2.circ)

a) Two-input decoder.
   * How many outputs does this decoder have?
	A) 4
   * What is the relationship between the number of inputs and the number of outputs of a decoder?
	A) n inputs = 2^n outputs
   * Make a truth table for the decoder.
	A | B |
	1 | 1 | 1000
	1 | 0 | 0010
	0 | 0 | 0001
	0 | 1 | 0100
   * Implement the decoder as a circuit in logisim.

b) Four-input encoder.  

An encoder is the opposite of a decoder.  If you take the outputs to a decoder and feed them into an encoder you should get whatever input you sent into the decoder.  That is ENCODER(DECODER(x)) == x.
   * How many inputs does this encoder have?
	A) 4
   * What is the relationship between the number of inputs and the number of outputs?
	A) n inputs = log(base 2)n outputs
   * What can break an encoder?
	A) For a 4 input decoder, there are more than 4 possible bit strings of length 4. Because of this there
	is more than one way to output the same bit string of length 2. This may cause problems if someone 
	assigns more than (in this case) 4 bit string combinations to mean something and uses the encoder.
   * Does a decoder have this problem?
	A) No because all combinations are accounted for.
   * Make a truth table for the encoder. (Note some combinations in the truth table you DO NOT CARE about so don't include them in the table).
	A | B | C | D | 
	1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 11
	0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 01
	0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 10
	0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 00
   * Implement the encoder as a circuit in logisim.

c) Make a mux with three select lines.
   * How many inputs does this mux have?
	A) Excluding the select lines, 8. Including them, 11.
   * How many outputs does this mux have?
	A) 1
   * What is the relationship between the number of inputs and select lines for a mux?
	A) There are 2^n inputs and n select lines for a mux.
   * Make a truth table for the mux.
	S1| S2| S3| 
	0 | 0 | 0 | A
	0 | 0 | 1 | B
	0 | 1 | 1 | C
	1 | 1 | 1 | D
	1 | 1 | 0 | E
	1 | 0 | 0 | F
	1 | 0 | 1 | G
	0 | 1 | 0 | H
   * Implement the mux as a circuit in logisim.
