This assignment comes with two assemblers/simulators. One set is the old one
in the gt16 folder, and another is a new one I wrote this past weekend because
I was annoyed with the old one.

If you do not plan to use the new assembler, you can stop reading after this
warning paragraph. Keep in mind that it will be harder to support if anything
goes wrong because the codebase is unnecessarily complicated.

The new assembler creates the same bytecode as the old gt16as, but in my
opinion it is both more robust and lightweight. At the same time, I wrote it
over the weekend because the old one was giving me problems and it was old
and outdated.

The new simulator is a work in progress and I will release it as an update to
the assignment shortly.

To use this new assembler, you must have perl installed on your system. It's
a fairly standard linux package so if it isn't already installed, installing
it should be as simple as a call to your favorite package manager:
# apt-get install perl
OR
# pacman -S perl
etc.

Another positive side is that it (supposedly) runs on windoze and OSX as well.
It hasn't been tested but any feedback would be appreciated. The only
difference is in how newlines are handled. You can download perl from
http://www.perl.org/get.html. I would recommend Strawberry Perl.
