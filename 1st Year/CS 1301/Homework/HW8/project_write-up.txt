
1)Our project is essentially a video that is similar to a compilation video one would post
  on youtube. We zoom out to see the player in third person to make the movie have
  a more cinematic experience rather than a plain "gameplay" video. The shots fired by the 
  main character are shown by a special effect we have that flashes adds a fire effect on the gun, and the
  shots fired by an opposing character are marked by the main character turning red, as in
  many first-person shooters. Our character defeats one adversary who appears from behind a
  couch, then swoops by the adversary's dying body, continuing on his killer path. Unfortunately, he gets
  shot by a "camper" from behind who is using height to his advantage.Our hero
  does not turn around and respond fast enough, and he dies. We manually flip the robot to
  show the main character's death, and used special effects to finalize it. 

  Some of the special effects we used include seeingRed(this was used for moments when our 
  main character was getting shot at, to show damange),a filter to place a gun onto all of the 
  videos that needed it (as in an FPS, where you continually have a gun
  on the screen), and a extra firing gun image to show gun shots. We also used zoom (as in a game when 
  you can increaes the accuracy of your aim by a short "zoom") and Crossfade to transition the hero scene in the beginning. 


2.The only deviations we made were inclusions of some images we needed for some functions in our
  editing code. Some of these images include muzzle_gun.jpg, and white_gun.jpg. The first image was
  used to edit in the image of an m4 in each frame as if one were filming an fps in first person. 
  The second image was used to edit in the image of the same m4 but with a muzzle flash in each
  frame. We did not, however, deviate from the coding that was recommended. Also, we added in the movie.gif 
  for the performanceCode.py.
