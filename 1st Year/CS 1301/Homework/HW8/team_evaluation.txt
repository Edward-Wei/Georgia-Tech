Our team (Joon Ki Hong, Jonathan Betancourt, and Victoria Arnold) created a movie which had a theme
of first person shooters. We broke down our project into three section for each member of the team.
Joon Ki was responsible for the editing code, by organizing our previous HW7 code onto the
editingCode.py file and additing any additional effects such as the gunfilter, gunfilterflash, SeeingRed, Flash,
and redFade functions. He also was responsible for editing the audio and video effects by making sure 
everything was in working order. 
Jonathan Betancourt was responsible for the performance code. Examples of such code are ForShow, LeftFilm, LeftShow, BackFilm, ForwFilm, BackShow, RightFilm,
RightShow, StationFilm, and StationShow functions. He was also responsible for setting up meeting times
based on everyone's schedules and keeping everyone up to date. Victora Arnold was responsible for
the plot development, plot concepts, ideas for special effects(acting code), and directing/planning out the
execution of the film along with Jonathan. 
The breakdown for percentages is provided below:
Joon Ki Hong: 33%
Jonathan Betancourt: 34%
Victoria Arnold: 33%
